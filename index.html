               Hey! I'm <strong>Janice</strong>. I always have some wonderful associations in my daily life. I find these<i> "flash" moments</i> very magical. Even though I don't remember exactly what I thought, but the magical feeling is still in my mind. I wanted to build a website to collect these ideas!Like a diary!

            <h1><span>How can blue be warm color?</span></h1>
            <p>
              Blue as a cool color can really represent warmth, if the Star in your Star system is blue giant star.
            </p>
            <p>
             The human eye visible light of those waves, red orange yellow green cyan purple...
            </p>
            <p>
             Because these are the waves that the sun's fusion mainly releases
            </p>
            <p>
             Red has a longer wavelength and a lower frequency
            </p>
            <p>
             Purple has shorter wavelength and higher frequency
            </p>
            <p>
             Short wavelength, high frequency, high energy
            </p>
            <p>
             Blue Star has high temperature and high energy
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe, life in the blue Star system cannot even see RED, and Organge, and Yellow
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe they can't see the whole warm color system, so it makes sense that cool colors represent warmth
            </p>
